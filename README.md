# AppFramework Extensions

Extensions get copied (or symlinked) into the TypeSupport folder of CESMII's [AppFramework](https://github.com/cesmii/AppFramework) to add support for different Types (aka Smart Manufacturing Profiles).

They should be written in pure Javascript and CSS against an HTML5 DOM, and load all their dependencies programmatically.
